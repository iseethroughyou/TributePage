  <h5 style="margin-top: 60px ">He set an example of racial pride for African Americans and resistance to white domination during the Civil Rights Movement. By the time the U.S. Supreme Court overturned his conviction in 1971, he had not fought for nearly four years and thereby lost a period of peak performance as an athlete. Ali's actions as a conscientious objector to the war made him an icon for the larger counterculture generation.</h5>
